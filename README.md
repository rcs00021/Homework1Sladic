- Project Overview 
	-	This project was to deign the first prototype 
of a bigger assignment we will be completing over the course 
of the semester. Functionality of this prototype did not need to 
be extensive at this time. This current version asks the user 
for simple inputs and selections from dropdown menus. 
	
# Heading 2 

- Page Descriptions 
	- This project has multiple pages. We have the following pages in this project
	- Index.cshtml - hold the structure of the main home page
	- Privacy.cshtml - show company privacy statement 
	- SearchResults.cshtml - show results queried after user inputs information and clicks search function
	- _Layout.cshtml - holds many layout code for the parts of this program
	- site.css - stores basic specifics of site points

- To meet the requirements I used the required different headings,used a search button 
	to connect the different pages, different HTML elements such as a header and footer 
   custome Bootstrap class, custom css, accouncement bars at the top of the webpage.

- Research Summaries 
- Indentifying Similar Websites 
	
	- https://www.aaa.com/autorepair/
	 When exploring this website, I noticed it used several key features
	 to create a friendlier user experience. For example one key aspect 
	 is the use of multiple drop down menus. With this design, the website
	 only actually requires the user to input two drop down selections as 
	 well as only a zip code to get a result. Additionally, this website
	 is constructed so it has the most popular user needs as their own 
	label “buttons” directly at the top of the page.


	- https://www.amazon.com
		While my project is tremendously smaller than anything about Amazon,
		 I chose to still analyze Amazon assuming they implement the best
		 user interface elements. I feel like with applications such as 
		 Amazon, people still look at suggested products, but I am convinced
		 that most purchases on the platform start with a general search in
		 the product search bar. Regardless, when you initially search and 
		 click on the website, there is no space that is not taken advantage
		 of to advertise. 


		- https://www.ebay.com/
		Similar to Amazon, I decided to analyze eBay as well. For the project,
	    my decision was to build a project that is classified as e-commerce so
	    I dove deep into the technical side of eBay to see what features and
	    key attributes the website utilizes. Ebay uses similar pieces Amazon does
	    obviously. Most importantly many hard buttons and drop down arrows but also
	  utilizing all of the open space on the main home screen

Researching Reposotories 
Identified Reposotories

		- https://github.com/hoemotion/hoemotion.github.io
		One thing I noticed about this repository is how many pieces of it are
		customized and not set or limited to defaults. While I was skeptical in
		the beginning due to the fact this was updated over three years ago, 
		this repository and the coded HTML aspects inside are still complete
		and thorough.

		- https://github.com/Yuvraj210103/Ecommerce
		This repository is an ecommerce based project. With my own project being 
		ecommerece based I wanted at least one of these repositories to be 
		ecommerce based as well. Some key things I noticed with this repository
		was how simplistic the home page was, but how the website was also easy 
		to navigate and still had every key component other websites do. I was
		personally a fan of this design more. 

# Heading 5

Future Enhancements
	
		- With this prototype not being fully functional, the room for future improvement 
		is endless. Next, I will focus on inplementing more buttons all with full function, 
		as well as more pages with more information to create a more informational website.
		This will be beneficial as it will provide the user with the ability to utilize the 
		website more efficiently. This will be beneficial for the user as well as our own
		system.

Reflection on Resources 
	
	- When completing this project, the sources I did use helped in parts where I was unfamilair with code. 
	Both of my different sources provided examples than I reworked and implemented into my project.
	In addition to these resources, I also used code samples from our class work and sample problems.
	Between all of these resources, I was able to create a example that met all of the requirements in
	the given prompt.
